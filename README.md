# Project Management Repository for SoilWise Horizon Europe

## Overview
This repository manages project activities and action points for the SoilWise Horizon Europe project. The goal is to capture, track, and follow up on action points from discussions among Work Package (WP) and task leads, and project partners. A Kanban-style project board is used to visualize the status of action points: To Do, In Progress, and Done.

## Project Structure
1. **Documentation**: Detailed project management documents, meeting minutes, and guidelines are stored in the SoilWise SharePoint. Issues may include links to these documents for reference.
   
2. **Issues**: GitHub issues track specific action points and tasks for resolution.

3. **Project Board**: GitHub Projects with a Kanban board to manage action points:
   - **To Do**: Planned or identified action points.
   - **In Progress**: Currently active action points.
   - **Done**: Completed action points.

## Using the Repository
1. **Creating Issues**: Create issues for new action points identified during meetings or workshops.
   
2. **Assigning Issues**: Assign issues to the responsible WP or task lead for ownership.

3. **Updating Progress**: Move issues across board columns as action points progress.

4. **Closing Issues**: Close issues with notes or links to documentation once action points are completed.

## Guidelines
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the board and issues updated to inform team members.
  
- **Communication**: Discuss details, updates, or blockers using issue comments. Tag relevant team members.

- **Documentation Links**: Include SharePoint document links in issues for easy access.
